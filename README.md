Repository of Data Science and Machine learning projects; It covers data analysis with linear and nonlinear regression, logistic regression, and gaussian processes.


Modeling Universe’s Accelerating Expansion-Fall 2021

	•  Proved Perlmutter’s Nobel Prize winning research; dark energy exists given the universe’s accelerating expansion
  
	•  Implemented Metropolis-Hasting MCMC algorithm to fit the recorded redshift and brightness of supernovae
  
	•  Compared the expected error of our cosmological parameters across other Bayesian methods such as maximum a
	    posteriori estimation (MAP) and Python libraries such as Bayesfast 


Galaxy Classifier-Fall 2021

	• Predicted new galaxies’ redshift and shape using spectral bands from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
  
	• Estimate spectroscopic redshift on celestial objects by implementing a K-nearest neighbors regression model
  
	• Distinguished between elliptical and spiral galaxies with a K-nearest neighbors classifier model

Handwriting Generator-Fall 2021

	•  Trained a Sliced Iterative Generator on MNIST dataset to generate handwritten numbers using PyTorch
  
	•  Improved image clarity and noise reduction by applying patch-based modeling accounting for neighboring pixels
